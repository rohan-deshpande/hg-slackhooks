    webhook_url = YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
    repo_name = YOUR_REPO_NAME
    username = YOUR_USER_NAME
    commit_url = http://example.com/101-sandbox/rev/
    icon_emoji = :turtle:

    [hooks]
    outgoing.slackhooks= python:/path/to/slackhooks.py:pushhook
```

You can test any hg hook and command by running the following code in your terminal while inside the repo

`hg --config hooks.pre-commit="export| grep HG_" commit`

Where `pre-commit` can be any hook you want to test and `commit` can be any command you want to test.
